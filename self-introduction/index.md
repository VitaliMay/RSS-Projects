### Self-Intoduction script

Hello everyone, my name’s Vitali, and I am an entry-level front-end developer. 
At least I am planning to become one).
I am really excited to be part of this Front-End Development course. I think I did a great job to advance that far.

Now some words about my education and work experience:
I have always been Interested in programming. 
Informatics and math were my favorite subjects at school. But I decided to enter Belarussian State Economic University because at that time it was a prestigious school.
I got a Bachelor's degree in Economics, and I've worked as the head of the Sales department in a big Belarussian pharmaceutical company. This company sold drugs. Yes, I used to sell drugs. Legal ones haha.  
I’ve also worked at a private company that sold medical equipment.  

One day I realized that I didn’t want to do this job for the rest of my life. And I started thinking about career change, programming seemed like a great option for me. 
I have a strong interest in web development and want to learn more about how to create user-friendly websites and applications. **I want to make a difference in people's lives.**
This is what CEOs of Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Facebook usually say. And I also say so).

I enjoy learning new skills. And on this course I can physically feel with every cell of my body how I’m improving (increasing) my knowledge and progressing in this area every single day. But sometimes it feels  like my head is going to explode. Because the amount of information is gigantic. 

WHAT IS INTERESTING FOR ME IN PROGRAMING  
Programming is interesting because it allows you to solve problems creatively and create new things. 
It's a field that is always changing, there is always something new to learn and explore. And, when you succeed in creating something functional, it feels really good! 
I think  It’s better than alcohol! 
But sometimes after completing Rolling scopes school task or test, I need a drink :)

Some random facts about me:
I am a native Belarussian and Russian speaker, and I can also speak Polish, and have a good understanding of Ukrainian, also I studied German at school, unfortunately. 
I studied English at a language school and with a private tutor who I ended up marrying.  
When I married an English language teacher I stopped learning the language, because I have my own personal interpreter.
I used to have B2 level, but now my English is a bit rusty. I understand a lot but it`s not easy for me to speak. 

In my free time I like reading, watching TV series, travelling and spending time with family, friends and my dog.

And I want to tell you one more thing:  
at the moment programming is quite difficult for me, but you know what?  
**I like it.**
